so our agaent would actually be very responsive
thinking loud
telling user every step
we have database



Let's imagine the user types: "Build a simple LED circuit with a 9V battery, a resistor, and a red LED."

Instead of just seeing the final circuit appear after a delay, the user would see a series of messages from the agent, almost like a real-time log of its "thoughts":

Agent: "Okay, building a simple LED circuit. First, I'll gather the components."

Agent: "Searching for a 9V battery, a standard red LED, and a suitable resistor..."

Agent: "Found them! Placing the battery and LED on the canvas now." (The components visually appear on the canvas).

Agent: "Now, for the resistor. To protect the LED, I'm calculating the required resistance... (9V - 2V) / 20mA = 350 ohms. The closest standard value is 390 ohms. I'll use that."

Agent: "Placing the 390-ohm resistor on the canvas." (The resistor appears).

Agent: "Wiring everything together: Battery positive to the resistor, resistor to the LED anode, and LED cathode back to the battery negative." (The wires visually appear on the canvas, connecting the components).

Agent: "The circuit is complete! I've set up a basic indicator circuit. Is there anything you'd like to change?"





So talking about how the agent will work

So firstly, the user inputt is parsed , the exact tool needed is determined, also with a list of thought process and actionable process in a json

a call to vectorizing if needed

(FIrst call)


then goes to quering database with vexctor,, or sending text or what ever of the capabilities

then uses actionabkle process to each point in agent streamer, understand?

then at end bunder vectors found, data and send back to LLM for deciding and then comes back with a fullk of what would be used, and then query db for exact in components_v2 and lay em down



///when i draw a wire from -48v , and i mive, the wire somehow changed to another -48v
