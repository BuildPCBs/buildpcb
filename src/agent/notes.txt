so our agaent would actually be very responsive
thinking loud
telling user every step
we have database



Let's imagine the user types: "Build a simple LED circuit with a 9V battery, a resistor, and a red LED."

Instead of just seeing the final circuit appear after a delay, the user would see a series of messages from the agent, almost like a real-time log of its "thoughts":

Agent: "Okay, building a simple LED circuit. First, I'll gather the components."

Agent: "Searching for a 9V battery, a standard red LED, and a suitable resistor..."

Agent: "Found them! Placing the battery and LED on the canvas now." (The components visually appear on the canvas).

Agent: "Now, for the resistor. To protect the LED, I'm calculating the required resistance... (9V - 2V) / 20mA = 350 ohms. The closest standard value is 390 ohms. I'll use that."

Agent: "Placing the 390-ohm resistor on the canvas." (The resistor appears).

Agent: "Wiring everything together: Battery positive to the resistor, resistor to the LED anode, and LED cathode back to the battery negative." (The wires visually appear on the canvas, connecting the components).

Agent: "The circuit is complete! I've set up a basic indicator circuit. Is there anything you'd like to change?"
